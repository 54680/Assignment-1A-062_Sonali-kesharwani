\section{\underline{INTRODUCTION} }
\begin{Large}
\begin{flushleft}


Addiction is a disease of brain it interrupt an addicts ability of 
taking good choices and make good decision yet we generally expects and 
addicts who as a brain disease to make disease brain to better choice you 
know we accuse them of a lack of will power they don’t understand the 
consequence of their action . Sometime this type of addiction make people 
criminal because they unable to understand what they do and and for his 
addiction things they do anything . Addiction of anything lock their mind, 
person unable to understand what was going on.

Fortunately, science thinking about and start working over a 
long time . The innovation of leader thinking of solution.
 Virtual Reality allows the people to go behind the compile 
screen to go into the world where the small molecules or protecting are being 
visualized and to really interact with them it allow chemist to both identifying 
potential drug molecules and then also optimize them more efficiently so it 
extremely important to be able to visualize these protein structure because 
they are so complex that understanding of patterns of how these molecules 
are spatially oriented with each other and how they interact tremendously 
helps the professional design of drugs. I like that it provide really a different 
perspective on the realities that were used to looking at you can touch them, 
you can move them, you can move in and outside of them. So you imagine that 
you being people into your virtual world

\section*{\underline{WHAT IS VIRTUAL REALITY?}}
\begin{large}
\begin{flushleft}
Virtual reality is computer generated environment that stimulates experience through senses and perception with headset. VR creates a fully immersive 
environment and completely shuts out the outside world. The user must be 
able to explore these 3D environment using VR headset lens and controller 
which might have sensors on them for users to be able to experience VR content

\section*{\underline{LEARNING TO SAY NO------}}
\begin{large}
\begin{flushleft}
When addicts ready to avoid abusing drugs there are many cases that run 
through their head. People faced relapsing problem that means the addicts 
want to avoid but they unable to do because still they have another friends or 
person in society who themselves struggling their own addiction which fraught 
them . With virtual reality addicts can practice these without worrying the 
affect of saying no. By successfully saying no to addiction a virtual setting

,addicts can feel more confident saying no once they leave treatment. Virtual 
reality program that addiction treatment centre can use to help them in 
practice saying no in temptation situation.

\section*{USING VR AS AN ADDICTION TREATMENT 
TOOL---------}
\begin{large}
\begin{flushleft}
Virtual reality program system allows addict to immersed them 
in different environment to adopt theraupatic support also the practice them 
in a variety of situation involving addiction of drugs. When patients arrive at a 
rehab facility in an agitated state, Virtual reality has been helpful in 
counteracting negative emotion. This method is low risk path to run through 
different high risk path.
 These therapies have the potential for use often addiction 
treatment as well, such as when an addict is anoxius and need immediate 
feedback.

\end{large}
\section*{\underline{HOW VIRTUAL REALITY WORKS:
}}
\begin{large}
\begin{flushleft}
Virtual reality is all about using a device 3D video or image camera to create a three-dimensional world that a user can manipulate and explore later or in real time using VR headsets and lenses, while feeling he or she is in that stimulated world. The user will see a life-size image and the resulting perception is that they are the part of that stimulation. Virtual reality involves a headset to immersed addicts in virtual world which is different from the reality. The 
picture or images addicts seen in VR make them realize that they are in different world but actually they are in present world . It helps to interact the 
world around you. The world are we seen is depend on type of treatment you got and it also depend on filmed used by special VR camera. It doesn’t matter

what was the scene we seen , these virtual world given chances to approach 
their addiction in a safe ,honest way without fear of relapsing ,succumbing to 
temptation.

\section*{\underline{Benefits of Virtual Reality Treatment 
On Addiction:}}
\begin{large}
\begin{flushleft}
People who suffered from drug addiction , searching a way to soberity which is insurmountable for them. Sometime a possibility is occur that people recovered but the path of fraught with temptation is ahead and this can back leads addicts to addiction.\\
Virtual reality helps them in soberity and give opportunity to fought against their addiction by keeping them in virtual world and distract them from their real life.\\
\vspace*{1cm}
\textbf{Fighting Craving:}\\
Craving is the strongest desired to do something as mind seek out the chemicals it grown the intense craving among addicted. These craving lead the 
directs the addicted from soberity. Virtual reality helps addict to frought against intense craving.

\section*{\underline{Conclusion:}}
\begin{large}
\begin{flushleft}
No matter from what type of drugs a person be 
addicted for all they faced pressure and temptation to relapse . VR build the confident to fought against the addiction. By experiencing these fears in a safe environment ,they can build up the skill set they need to confidently manage these experience take on in their lives and avoid falling back into addiction 
cycle again.\\
We need to really brave now when imaging them problem and have to work hard to fulfilled these goals. We need to make sure that the used of virtual reality in addiction treatment is based on human touch and on the partnership of addicted and their care takers and is based on technology that can given use the absolute best success rate the best treatment and skills the best care when it comes to people
